            Review this PR for the Text to Audio WordPress plugin. Focus on:

            1. **Code Quality**: PHP coding standards, WordPress best practices
            2. **Security**: Input sanitization, nonce verification, capability checks
            3. **Performance**: Efficient database queries, proper caching usage
            4. **Compatibility**: WordPress 6.9+ and PHP 7.2.24+ compatibility
            5. **Internationalization**: Proper use of translation functions

            Provide specific, actionable feedback with code suggestions where appropriate.
            Reference the project's CLAUDE.md for context about the plugin architecture.
